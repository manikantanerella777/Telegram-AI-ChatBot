# üìå Create Your Own AI Chatbot on Telegram
This guide will walk you through building a Python-powered AI chatbot using Telegram, OpenAI, and Gemini models. Customize your bot, integrate AI capabilities, and deploy it efficiently!

## ‚ö° Features
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ User Registration
Stores first name, username, and chat_id in MongoDB upon first interaction.
Uses Telegram‚Äôs contact button to request and store the phone number.
Sends a confirmation message after successful registration.
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ AI-Powered Chat (Gemini & OpenAI)
Uses Google‚Äôs Gemini API (google.generativeai) for AI-powered conversations.
Supports multi-LLM routing (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) in routes.py.
Stores full chat history (user input + bot response) in MongoDB with timestamps.
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Image & File Analysis
Accepts images (JPG, PNG) and PDFs.
Uses Gemini AI to analyze and describe their content.
Saves file metadata (filename, description, etc.) in MongoDB.
### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Web Search Integration
Users can perform a web search by typing /websearch.
The bot fetches an AI-generated summary along with top web links.
## üöÄ Quick Start Guide
### üîπ Prerequisites
A Telegram account
A Telegram Bot API token (from BotFather)
An OpenAI API key (Get it here)
A Google Gemini API key (Get it here)
Docker & docker-compose installed
### üîπ Setup & Installation
#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/your-username/Telegram-AI-ChatBot.git
cd Telegram-AI-ChatBot
```

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file and add your API keys:

```bash
TELEGRAM_TOKEN="your_telegram_bot_token"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
BOTNAME="your_bot_name"
TAVILY_API_KEY="your_tavily_api_key"
USERS="allowed_users"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_anthropic_api_key"
```
#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Bot with Docker
```bash
docker-compose up
```
üéâ Congratulations! Your AI chatbot is now live on Telegram!

Configuration Guide
üîπ Model Selection
Define your LLM (Large Language Model) in routes.py.
Supports OpenAI, Gemini, and Anthropic models.
If changing models in conf.py, ensure you restart the vector database (as dimensions vary per model).
üîπ Database Setup
Uses MongoDB to store user data, chat history, and file metadata.
Ensure MongoDB is running before starting the bot.
üì∏Screenshot & Usage


Step 1: Setting up your Telegram bot
Before diving into the code, you'll need to create a new bot on Telegram. Follow these simple steps:

Open the Telegram app and search for the "BotFather" bot.
Start a chat with BotFather and send the command "/newbot" to create a new bot.
Choose a name and username for your bot. BotFather will provide you with a unique API token, which you'll need later. Save it somewhere safe.
Step 2: Cloning the code repository
Clone the code repository from GitHub using the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone --recursive https://github.com/emingenc/telegramGPT.git
cd telegramGPT
Step 3: Installing the dependencies
Install the required dependencies using the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
Step 4: Exploring the code
In our project, we have four main files:

telegram_bot.py: The main script that handles the Telegram bot's functionality.
gpt_message_handler.py: Contains functions for interacting with OpenAI's GPT models and managing chat history.
conf.py: A configuration file to store the list of allowed users.
requirements.txt: Lists the required Python libraries for the project.
Step 5: Configuring the bot
Edit conf.py to add the usernames of users allowed to interact with your bot. For example:

python
Copy
Edit
users = ["your_telegram_username"]
Step 6: Setting up the environment variables
You need to set up environment variables: TELEGRAM_TOKEN (the API token you received from BotFather) and OPENAI_API_KEY (your OpenAI API key). BOTNAME (name of bot) You can either add them to your system's environment variables or use a .env file.

Step 7: Running the bot
Start your bot by running the telegram_bot.py script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python3 telegram_bot.py
Your bot is now up and running! Start a chat with your Telegram bot and see it in action.

Conclusion
Congratulations! You've just built your own chatbot using Python, Telegram, and OpenAI GPT models. Now you can enjoy the power of AI through a personalized, engaging chat experience on Telegram. Don't forget to share your thoughts and experiences in the comments below. Happy coding!
